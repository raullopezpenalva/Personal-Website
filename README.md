# Personal Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal website, built as static application using React and Vite.
The website serves as a professional portfolio and a space to present my background, experience and technical perspective.
Beyond being a portfolio, this project is also an exercise in clean frontend architecture, component-driven design, and modern deployment workflows.
